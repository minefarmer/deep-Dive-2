                        What are sequences

Indexing starting at 0
slices include lower bound index, but exclude upper bound index
slicing
slice objects
modifying mutable sequences
copying sequences - shallow and deep
implementing custom sequence types
sorting
list comprehensions



                        Built-in Sequence types

mutable     lists       bytearrays

immutable   strings     tuples     bytes
                           \         \
                            \        more limited than lists, strings and tuples
                             \
                              in reality a tuple is more than just a sequence type


Additional standard types:      collections package     namedtuple
                                                        deque

                                array module            array



                        Homogeneous vs Heterogeneous Sequences

Strings are homogeneous sequences
    each element is of the same type (a character)      'python


Lists are heterogeneous sequences
    each element may be of a different type     [1. 10.5. 'python']



Homogeneous sequence types are usually more efficient (storage wise at least)
    e.g. prefer using a string of characters, rather than a list or tuple of characters
